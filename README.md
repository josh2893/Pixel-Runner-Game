## 🎮 Gameplay

### Controls and Mechanics
- **Run & Dash** – Move freely across the playfield using WASD or Arrow Keys. Hit Shift to dash, slipping past spikes or diving for pickups. On touch devices, use the on‑screen D‑pad and **Dash** button.
- **Orbs & Combos** – Collect Pixel Orbs to earn points and build up a score multiplier. Chain orbs quickly to climb your combo all the way to x5.
- **Bombs** – Gather Bomb Pickups and detonate them with Space or the on‑screen **Bomb** button to wipe out incoming spikes in a glorious pixel explosion.
- **Lives** – Grab rare glowing Heart Pixels to recover lost lives (capped at 5).
- **Star Mode** – Snag a rainbow Star Orb to enter a brief state of cosmic invincibility. While active, you move faster, leave a rainbow trail, and zap spikes just by touching them.

## 🌟 Features
- Sliding legend that appears during gameplay to remind you of hazards and power-ups.
- Dynamic intro with a wavy “PIXEL RUNNER” logo that explodes into pieces and reforms at the top of the screen.
- Lore and instructions accessible via intro buttons.
- Scoreboard and rank at game over, with stats like Orbs Collected, Bombs Used, Max Combo, and Time Survived.
- Cosmic audio powered by a custom WebAudio synth — pulsing tones, filtered noise, and bassy explosions.
- Polished visual effects including particle showers, HUD flashes, floating point popups, and screen shake for bomb blasts.

## 📜 Lore (short version)

In the Neon Drift, pixels aren’t just data — they’re citizens. You are a Runner, ferrying Pixel Orbs through corrupted star-lanes where rogue Arrows hunt anything that moves. Bombs are compressed rollback packets, Orbs are living memories, and Star Orbs are fragments of ancient code that briefly sync you with the cosmic rhythm.

⚡️ Pixel Runner is about rhythm, reflex, and flow. Survive longer, chase higher scores, and ride the wave of pixels as the Drift fights back.
