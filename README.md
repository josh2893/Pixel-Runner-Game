Pixel Runner — Neon Drift Edition



Pixel Runner is a fast-paced HTML5 arcade game where you guide a living pixel courier through the glitching expanse of the Neon Drift. Every pixel, orb, and blast isn’t just light — it’s alive.



🎮 Gameplay



Run \& Dash — Move freely across the playfield using WASD/Arrow Keys. Hit Shift to dash, slipping past spikes or diving for pickups.



Orbs \& Combos — Collect Pixel Orbs to earn points and build up a score multiplier. Chain orbs quickly to climb your combo all the way to x5.



Bombs — Gather Bomb Pickups and detonate them with Space to wipe out incoming spikes in a glorious pixel explosion.



Lives — Grab rare glowing Heart Pixels to recover lost lives (capped at 5).



Star Mode — Snag a rainbow Star Orb to enter a brief state of cosmic invincibility. While active, you move faster, leave a rainbow trail, and zap spikes just by touching them.

📜 Lore (short version)



In the Neon Drift, pixels aren’t just data — they’re citizens. You are a Runner, ferrying Pixel Orbs through corrupted star-lanes where rogue Arrows hunt anything that moves. Bombs are compressed rollback packets, Orbs are living memories, and Star Orbs are fragments of ancient code that briefly sync you with the cosmic rhythm.



⚡️ Pixel Runner is about rhythm, reflex, and flow. Survive longer, chase higher scores, and ride the wave of pixels as the Drift fights back.
